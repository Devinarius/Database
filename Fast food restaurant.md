**Description of the Data System**  
**User functionality of the database participants**  
In this database system, I model and track the theoretical operation of a fast-food restaurant. Through this, I attempt to demonstrate its functionality. The operations are as follows: there are employees (cashier, kitchen staff, shift leader, manager), each with different roles and responsibilities. The cashier takes the order, which may consist of products. For menus, a drink can be selected, which the customer can choose. In the background, the database has separate menus for different drinks, so if two identical menus have different drinks, they are considered two different menus. The customer may inquire about available menus and which products contain allergenic ingredients. After this, the order is assigned a start time, and we know that the order is still pending. Before payment, the customer may apply any discounts. The order is considered closed when it has been paid for, and the cashier has delivered the order, meaning the transaction has ended, and the order is finalized. The product is the smallest orderable unit, for example, a small hamburger. A product may consist of several ingredients, such as the small hamburger, which consists of a small bun, meat, tomato, and cheese. To offer a wider selection, the restaurant provides products in different sizes. There are three options: small, medium, and large. In the kitchen, the employees (kitchen staff) can see the order and prepare the products from the specified ingredients. Menus can be assembled from specific products, depending on the order placed. A product is discarded if an employee in the kitchen makes a mistake or if a complaint is received about a particular product. At the end of the day, the shift leader and manager together query the orders and discards, and from these, they calculate what needs to be ordered for the next restocking. During inventory, the quantity of the ingredients (the building blocks of the products, such as small buns) is checked by the shift leader or manager. The attendance of employees is also stored.  
We are not dealing with permissions or whether there are multiple restaurants in this context.

# **Database design with the creation of necessary entities:**

**INGREDIENT:** these are the components that make up the products.  
**INGREDIENT {ID, name, allergen, quantity, unit of measurement}**

**PRODUCT:** the specific product that can be purchased, which may also be part of a menu. This is what is prepared and sold.  
**PRODUCT {productID, name, isMenuItem, price}**

**CASH REGISTER:** a specific register that will be part of the cashier system. Its status can be active or inactive.  
**CASH REGISTER {ID, status, store}**

**CASHIER:** determines which employee is currently the cashier  
{cashRegisterID, cashOpen, cashClose, employeeID}

**ORDER:** at which cash register and when the order took place  
{receiptNumber, cashRegister, cashOpen, start, end, discountID}

**ORDER_ITEM:** the items of the order with the purchased quantities  
{receiptNumber, productID, quantity}

**DISCARD:** discarding a product due to spoilage, dropping, or other issues, categorized by ingredient  
{ID, ingredientID, date, reason, quantity}

**DISCOUNT:** the discount applied to a given order, valid for a specific time period, usable at the end of any order, and deducted from the total amount  
**DISCOUNT {ID, percentage, name, description, validityStart, validityEnd}**

**COMPLAINT:** a complaint after the order if the product is not suitable for consumption due to some issue  
**COMPLAINT {ID, receiptNumber, productID, reason, date}**

**PRODUCT_COMPOSITION:** the ingredients used to prepare a given product  
{ingredientID, productID}

**MENU_COMPOSITION:** the products that make up a given menu  
{productID, menuItem}

**EMPLOYEES:** records of employee data  
{ID, name, birthPlace, birthDate, taxNumber, positionID}

**ATTENDANCE:** when and on which day an employee clocked in and clocked out  
{employeeID, checkIn, checkOut}

**POSITION:** the position of a given employee in the restaurant  
{employeeID, title, hourlyWage}

**Data-level Description of Functions**

**Recording an Order Item**

- A new row is inserted into the **Order_Item** table from the **Order** table (INSERT)
- A new row is inserted into the **Order_Item** table from the **Product** table (UPDATE)
- **Order_Item.Quantity** is continuously updated by adding the number of **Order_Item.ProductID** rows within a single **Order_Item.ReceiptNumber** (UPDATE)

**Discarding**

- A new row is inserted into the **Discard** table
- The kitchen discard is manually recorded
- A new row is inserted into the **Complaint** table
- Based on **Order_Item**, it is manually recorded

**Recording/Adding a Complaint: COMPLAINT**  
New row:

**Adding Product Composition - New Record:**

- The product is entered, and the **ProductID** is recorded in **ProductComposition**.
- Ingredients are entered for the given **ProductID**.

**Concepts**

- Prices are amounts, payable values, all representing net values.
- The quantity of ingredients always refers to the amount needed for a single product, according to the unit of measure for that material.
- The ingredient identifier identifies ingredients, while the product identifier identifies products.
- By "discard," we mean the ingredients that are discarded.
- Complaints can be made about ordered products within a certain period.
- A "menu item" refers to products organized into a menu.
- The start of the order indicates the beginning of the transaction, while the end marks its completion, closing the transaction.
